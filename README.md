# High School In Hand

This project was a built in 2018 as a project for World Wide Technology's Hack-A-Thon. The concept, giving middle school students in the Saint Louis Public Schools (SLPS) district a way to find their high school of best fit, won first prize of 20 schools. The website is not fully operational, it is only a prototype of a potential final product. Some key features include a filterable list of schools and a quiz for middle schoolers to find their compatability with the SLPS high schools.
