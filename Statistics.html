    <h1>Statistics</h1>
    <p>8th graders do not know their options when picking out high school. There are 13 high school each with their own specialization, if they don’t participate in the school selection process they might end up in a high school that is not a good fit

Did you know that almost 40% of St.Louis High Schoolers dropped out for the school year 2016-2017,and for the year of 2011-2012, almost 50% dropped out for that school year
(http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2016/10/17/st-louis-public-schools-graduation-rate-below-national-average/).
2% of the dropout reasoning was because of the school they didn't feel comfortable at the school, 20.3% dropout because school was not releven towards their life at that time (http://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-reasons-students-drop-out-of-high-school-2015-10). We as a collective speculate that the 20.3% of students didn’t believe that school was relevant because they did not like the school they were at and they did not have a choice.

While our district has choices, the student doesn't always know their choices. With the studies in New York it shows when students have a choice, it improves graduation rates, and college readiness.
